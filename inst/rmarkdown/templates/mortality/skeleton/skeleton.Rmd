In this lab we will calculate death rates per year in the US from 1933 to 2014.  As always, we'll start by loading the necessary libraries.
 
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')
library('HMDHFDplus')

```

Just like when we calculated the birth rates, let's start with pulling the annual population from mortality.org.  When we pull it, it provides population information by age.  When we format the data using the "aggregate" function, what we are doing is combining the population at each age within a year to get a single population count for all ages in a given year.

````{r}
population <- readHMDweb(CNTRY='USA', item='Population', username='YOUR MORTALITY.ORG USERNAME', password='YOUR MORTALITY.ORG PASSWORD')
total_pop_by_year <- aggregate(x=population[4:9], by=list(Year=population$Year), FUN=sum)
total_pop_by_year <- dplyr::select(total_pop_by_year, Year, Total1)
total_pop_by_year <- dplyr::rename(total_pop_by_year, Population=Total1)

````

Now let's pull the data on number of deaths in the US.  As with the population data, this information comes broken down by year and ages.  To get a single death rate per year, we'll need to aggregate the deaths at all ages in a given year to get a single number of deaths per year.

````{r}
deathcount <- readHMDweb(CNTRY='USA', item='Deaths_1x1', username='YOUR MORTALITY.ORG USERNAME', password='YOUR MORTALITY.ORG PASSWORD')
deaths_by_year <- aggregate(x=deathcount[3:5], by=list(Year=deathcount$Year), FUN=sum)
deaths_by_year <- dplyr::select(deaths_by_year, Year, Total)
deaths_by_year <- dplyr::rename(deaths_by_year, Deaths=Total)

````

Right now we have two different datasets, each with one of the pieces of information we need.  We have the dataset total_pop_by_year with annual population data, and we have deaths_by_year with annual death counts.  To put these together into a single dataset that we'll call deathdata, we'll use the merge function.

````{r}
deathdata <- merge(total_pop_by_year, deaths_by_year, by='Year')

````

Now go ahead and calculate the death rate on your own.  This will be identical to calculating the birth rate from the last lab, however we're using death data instead of birth data.  Remember, to name a particular variable, you'll need to specify the dataset, use the $ sign, then specify the variable.  For example, if we want to create a new variable called "deaths_population" in the "deathdata" dataset, we'll need to call it deathdata$deaths_population for R to understand.

````{r}
#calculate deaths divided by population here


#calculate (deaths/population)*1000 here



````

Finally, we'll plot the annual death rates.  You'll need to fill in the death rate variable with the name you gave for the variable above.

````{r}
ggplot(deathdata, aes(x=Year, y=YOUR DEATH RATE VARIABLE)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("US Death Rate 1933-2014")

````
