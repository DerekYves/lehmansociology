# Title

Write an introduction here.
Describe the variables you are using.

```{r}
# Recreate our basic education_and_poverty data
poverty13 <- select (poverty.states, FIPStxt, Area_Name, PCTPOVALL_2013)
poverty13$FIPS.Code <- as.integer(poverty13$FIPStxt)

lessthanhighschool13 <- select(education.states, Area.name, FIPS.Code,
                        Percent.of.adults.with.less.than.a.high.school.diploma..2009.2013)

education_and_poverty <- merge(poverty13, lessthanhighschool13,
                               by.x='FIPS.Code', by.y='FIPS.Code')

```




````{r read_regions, message=FALSE }
#type your code here
# First let's create the region data set
gs_region<-gs_url('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_jY4A44WoSLkrqhwZZ9oJh51N2GybwVvGgEaY3n2gc/pubhtml')
region_data<-gs_read(gs_region)

````

```{r merge_data}

# Add the region variable to education_and_poverty by matching the FIPS code
education_and_poverty <- merge(education_and_poverty, region_data, 
                               by.x='FIPS.Code', by.y='FIPS.Code')

```

Now let's confirm our distributions of regions and divisions by making tables

```{r regions_table}

table(region_data$region)
prop.table(table(region_data$region))

# Add your table for division here


```


```{r regions_tablex, results="asis"}
# More complicated, but nicer looking ... pick which version you want to keep.
options(xtable.comment = FALSE)
xtable(table(region_data$region))
xtable(prop.table(table(region_data$region)))

# Add your table for division here


```

What is the mode for region?

What is the mode for division?


## Analysis
Next we will compare poverty and education within the different regions using a box plot. 
When you are happy with your poverty box plots, make boxplots for 
Percent.of.adults.with.less.than.a.high.school.diploma..2009.2013

```{r boxplots}

# In R, the term factor is used for nominal variables.
ggplot(education_and_poverty, aes(x=factor(region), y=PCTPOVALL_2013)) +
 geom_boxplot(aes(fill = "white")) +
 #Uncomment the line below to add the mean to your plot
 #stat_summary(fun.y = 'mean', geom = "point", shape = 23, size = 3, fill = "white") +
 guides(fill=FALSE) +
  ggtitle("") +
  labs(y = "",   x="")


```

A box plot shows: 
 * The median (50th percentile, second quartile) (dark line in the middle)  
 * The first quartile (25th percentile) (low value of box)  
 * The third quartile (75th percentile) (high value of box of box)  
 * The interquartile range is the distance from the high edge to the low edge  
 * Lines showing how far 1.5 * the Interquartile range would extend above and 
below the boxes.
 * Points for individual outliers that are beyond the lines.  

Now we will do the same comparison (of means and medians) with a table of values.

```{r comparison_table}


# You can add any othe statistics you want, such as max() or min()
education_and_poverty %>% group_by(region) %>% summarize(mean(PCTPOVALL_2013), median(PCTPOVALL_2013), IQR(PCTPOVALL_2013))

# Now do the same thing for the percent with less than high school degree.


```

More complicated but nicer looking, choose one and delete the one you don't want.


```{r comaprison_tablesx,  results="asis"}

# You can add any othe statistics you want, such as max() or min()
comparison_poverty<-education_and_poverty %>% 
  group_by(region) %>%  
     summarize('Mean' = mean(PCTPOVALL_2013), median(PCTPOVALL_2013), IQR(PCTPOVALL_2013))
xtable(comparison_poverty, caption = 'Percent in Poverty by Region')

# Now do the same thing for the percent with less than high school degree.


```


## Conclusion
Write a paragraph summarizing what you learned about the differences between (or lack of differences) in poverty and education in the regions.



Write a paragraph comparing the presentation of the results in the table and the presentation of the results in the graphs.
Which do you think is more effective? Why?
