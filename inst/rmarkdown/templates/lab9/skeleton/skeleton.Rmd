#Lab 9

Notice the echo=FALSE, message=FALSE here.  If you want to hide your R code you can do that by adding those inside the {}.
We are going to load some packages we need for making nice looking histograms.
````{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library('lehmansociology')
library('ggplot2')
library(scales)
library(grid)
````

We are going to be working with the addhealth data so let's attach it.
````{r}
attach(addhealth)
````


The first thing we are going to do is to create some new variables where the hours over 50 are rounded down to 50. If you want to round to a different number change the 50 to that number.
In English the first line of code means:
If tvhrs is greater than 50, set the new variable to 50, otherwise set it to tvhrs.
````{r}
tvhrs_rounded50<-ifelse (tvhrs > 50, 50, tvhrs)

````

Let's get descriptive statistics for the original variables and for the new variables.

````{r}
summary(tvhrs)
summary(tvhrs_rounded50)

````

Let's get a histogram for the original and for the new variables.
Be sure to add appropriate and descriptive title and labels for the axes.
````{r}
ggplot(addhealth, aes(tvhrs)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, fill="black") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Figure #")



ggplot(addhealth, aes(tvhrs_rounded50)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, fill="black") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Figure #")
````

Looking at the histograms for tvhrs and tvhrs_rounded50, do you see another point at which you think it would be interesting to round off the right side of the distribution? Create a new variable below and then get the summary statistics and histogram for your new variable. Note: be sure to change your variable name to something that helps us know what the variable represents.

````{r}

tvhrs_roundednew<-ifelse (tvhrs > 50, 50, tvhrs)
summary(tvhrs_roundednew)
ggplot(addhealth, aes(tvhrs_roundednew)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, fill="black") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Figure #")

````

Now let's get the distribution by race and ethnicity as coded by addhealth
````{r}
aggregate(tvhrs, by=list(raceeth), summary)

````


Now what if we create separate histograms for each race/ethnic group as coded by addhealth
````{r}
ggplot(addhealth, aes(tvhrs)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, fill="black") +
  facet_wrap(~raceeth) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Figure #")
````

Now we will get proportion distributions (known as density) for each group.
Notice two changes. First, the addition of the aes(y=..density..)  inside the geom_histogram.
Second we use the scale_y_continuous with the option of percent to change the display proportions into percents.
You can try the same graph without the scale option to see the difference.

There are many ways you can customize appearance of the graph. If you are interested in exploring you can search for information on ggplot.

````{r}

ggplot(addhealth, aes(tvhrs)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),binwidth=1, fill="black") +
  facet_wrap(~raceeth) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Figure #")

````

We can also plot the rounded data.
````{r}

ggplot(addhealth, aes(tvhrs_rounded50)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),binwidth=1, fill="black") +
  facet_wrap(~raceeth) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Figure #")

````
