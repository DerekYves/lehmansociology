Note that this template adds a new library. This library gives you more options for getting descriptive statistics for your variables. The chunk below shows you some of those options.
```{r}
median(GSS$childs)
mean(GSS$childs)
min(GSS$childs)
max(GSS$childs)
range(GSS$childs)
```

Remember that we can get a median for an ordinal variable. However, when we ran summary(GSS$health) above, R did not give us the median of health. This is because we need to tell R to treat health as a numeric variable because it thinks health is a factor/character variable. Recall from swirl lesson that we've done this using as.numeric. Also, when R thinks health is a factor/character variable, it does not know that NA is not a valid value for the variable. Also recall from the swirl that we use na.rm=TRUE for missing values. 
```{r}
GSS$health.numeric <-as.numeric(GSS$health)
summary(GSS$health.numeric, na.rm=TRUE)
median(GSS$health.numeric, na.rm=TRUE)
```

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LEAVE na.rm=TRUE OUT OF THE MEDIAN STATEMENT ABOVE. WHY?

NOW ADD A CHUNK AND GET APPROPRIATE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR 2 GSS VARIABLES THAT WE HAVE NOT USED IN THIS LAB. WRITE A FEW SENTENCES TO INTERPRET THE STATISTICS THAT YOU GET.
