*CHOOSE ONE OF THE VARIABLES IN THE CHUNK ABOVE AND INDICATE WHICH VALUE IS THE MOST COMMON (I.E., THE MODE).

THERE ARE OFTEN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO CODE THE SAME THING IN R, BUT DEPENDING ON THE CODE THAT YOU WRITE, YOU MAY GET THE INFORMATION IN A DIFFERENT WAY.
*QUESTION: WHAT ARE DIFFERENCES THAT YOU SEE BETWEEN THE TWO SETS OF CODE ABOVE?

*QUESTION: WHY DID SUMMARY GIVE YOU VERY DIFFERENT INFORMATION FOR CHILDS AND AGE THAT YOU DIDN'T GET FOR SEX AND HEALTH?

*QUESTION: WHICH COMMAND --TABLE, CROSSTAB, OR SUMMARY --DO YOU PREFER? WHY?
