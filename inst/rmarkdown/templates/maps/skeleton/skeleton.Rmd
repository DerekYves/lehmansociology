In this template we will use the poverty data to make maps using the maps package. You can also make maps in ggplot2.

To see a nicely formatted copy of this click on the Knit HTML button at the top of this window.

###This shows the outline maps for the US, states and counties.


# Make some empty maps (just to show how to do it in the maps package)
map("usa")
map("state")
map("county")

# This loads the fips information from the county map data. Only includes the lower 48 states.
data(county.fips)

````

## Introduction
Write your introduction here.



```{r setupmaps}
# First we need to load an extra library

states_map <- map_data("state")

```


```{r mapdata}

education_and_poverty$state <- tolower(education_and_poverty$Area_Name)

education_and_poverty_map <- merge(states_map, education_and_poverty, 
                                 by.x = "region", by.y="state")

```


This actually makes the map, and you an see that this part is very similar to every other ggplot.

```{r createemap}
# If you want to try colors uncomment the next line and change to the color you want.
# Also uncomment the scale_fill_gradientn line.
# You can change the color and the number of colors.

#colors<-brewer.pal(7,"Greens")
ggplot(education_and_poverty_map, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group, 
                                      map_id = region, fill = PCTPOVALL_2013)) +
  geom_map(map = education_and_poverty_map, color = "black" ) +
  #scale_fill_gradientn(colors=colors) +
  coord_map("polyconic") +
  ggtitle("Fig #: ")

```
