In this template we are going to produce a lot of variations of histograms and some other visualizations of a single interval variable..
For your analyses you should pick the one that produces the best information and communicates it most effectively.

For this analysis we will use the `poverty.counties` data. You can see the raw data by clicking on the dataset name in the Environment window.

For the example we will use `PCTPOVALL_2013` which we will refer to as `poverty.counties$PCTPOVALL_2013`.  It is very important that you spell the name correctly including capitalization.

There are many options in making graphs with R. This template will just show a few very simple graphs for one variable, but you should explore these either in the help files or by searching the internet.

#Graphs

##Simple Histogram
````{r echo=TRUE}

hist(poverty.counties$PCTPOVALL_2013)
hist(poverty.counties$PCTPOVALL_2013, breaks=c(0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,50,60),
     main="Distribution of Poverty Rate by Country, 2013", xlab="Percent in Poverty" )
ggplot(poverty.counties, aes(x=poverty.counties$PCTPOVALL_2013)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.5)

 ggplot(poverty.counties, aes(x=poverty.counties$PCTPOVALL_2013)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.5, aes(y = ..density..))  +
    geom_density(color="blue")

## Stem and leaf. These work better with less data so use states.
stem(poverty.states$PCTPOVALL_2013, 1)

## Cumulative
 ggplot(poverty.counties, aes(x=poverty.counties$PCTPOVALL_2013)) +
          geom_histogram(binwidth=2, aes(y=cumsum(..count..)))


## These will often be better when you are comparing two or more groups. You can
## do that by changing the options.
## Boxplot
boxplot(poverty.counties$PCTPOVALL_2013, horizontal=TRUE, col="blue")

ggplot(poverty.counties, aes(factor(1),
    poverty.counties$PCTPOVALL_2013))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(color=factor(1))) +
  labs(x = " ", y = "Percent", title = "Percent Poverty for Counties in 2013") +
   theme(legend.position = "none")

# Jitter
ggplot(poverty.counties, aes(factor(1),
    poverty.counties$PCTPOVALL_2013)) +
  labs(x = " ", y = "Percent", title = "Percent Poverty for Counties in 2013") +
  geom_jitter(alpha=I(1/4), aes(color=factor(1))) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
