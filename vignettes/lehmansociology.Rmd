Lehmansociology is a package that we are creating as we develop the course Sociology 345
Quantitative Analysis of Sociological Data at Lehman College.

In this package we are mainly relying on base r plus the family of somewhat related
packages that includes ggplot2, knitr, dplyr, broom, and printr. We also use a few other
packages such as Googlesheets for reading data, xtable for nice tables and maps for 
creating maps. 

Our goal is to be as simple as we can but not too simple.  We choose these packages rather
than educationally-oriented packages because they are more useful if students try to
do data analysis in the workplace or in other classes. 

The vignettes are going to show some important examples of how to use this package.
