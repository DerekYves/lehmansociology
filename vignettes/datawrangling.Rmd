Data wrangling is one term for working with data to get it into a format that can be
used for proper analysis.

Data wrangling can mean importing data, cleaning data, merging different datsets, and creating new variables and new data sets based on transformation of existing datasets.

In R what sociologists usually call a dataset is usually stared in a format called a dataframe.
